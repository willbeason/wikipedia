'''Albert Einstein''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|n|s|t|aɪ|n}} {{respell|EYEN|styne}};<ref name="NDxay" /> {{IPA-de|ˈalbɛɐt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn|lang|Albert Einstein german.ogg}}; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born<!-- Please do not change this—see talk page and its many archives.--> [[theoretical physicist]] who is widely held as one of the most influential [[scientist|scientists]]. Best known for developing the [[theory of relativity]], Einstein also made important contributions to [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name="frs" /><ref name="YangHamilton2010" /> His [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula {{math|1=[[Mass–energy equivalence#Mass–velocity relationship|''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>]]}}, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".<ref name="LnLVo" /> He received the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the [[photoelectric effect]]",<ref name="Nobel Prize" /> a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. 

Born in the [[German Empire]], Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]])<ref name="GEcitizen" group="note" /> the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss [[ETH Zurich|federal polytechnic school]] in [[Zürich]], graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1903, he secured a permanent position at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the [[University of Zurich]]. In 1914, he moved to [[Berlin]] in order to join the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. In 1917, he became director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]]; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].<ref name="GEcitizen" group="note" /> In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Adolf Hitler came to power]] in Germany. Horrified by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Anti-Jewish legislation in pre-war Nazi Germany|war of extermination]] against his fellow Jews,<ref name="zE9Bz" /> Einstein decided to remain in the US, and was granted [[American citizen]]ship in 1940.<ref name="BoyerDubofsky2001" /> On the eve of [[World War II]], he endorsed [[Einstein–Szilard letter|a letter]] to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] alerting him to the potential [[German nuclear weapons program]] and recommended that the US begin [[Manhattan Project|similar research]]. Einstein supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] but generally viewed the idea of [[nuclear weapon]]s with great dismay.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Albert Einstein on nuclear weapons {{!}} Wise International |url=https://wiseinternational.org/nuclear-monitor/802/albert-einstein-nuclear-weapons |access-date=23 October 2022 |website=wiseinternational.org}}</ref>

Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the [[philosophy of science]].<ref name="xZQWt" /><ref name="3UiiT" /> In 1905, he published [[Annus mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]], sometimes described as his ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' (miracle year).{{sfnp|Galison|2000|p=377}} These papers outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained [[Brownian motion]], introduced his [[special theory of relativity]]—a theory which addressed the inability of [[classical mechanics]] to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the [[electromagnetic field]]—and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a [[general theory of relativity]] that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate [[gravitation]]. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the [[universe]] as a whole.<ref name="Nobel" /><ref name="NYT-20151124" />

In the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of [[radiation]], in which light consists of particles, subsequently called [[photon]]s. With the [[India]]n physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], he laid the groundwork for [[Bose-Einstein statistics]]. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that "God does not play dice".<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4 |title=Did Einstein really say that? |last=Robinson |first=Andrew |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=30 April 2018 |volume=557 |number=30 |page=30 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-05004-4 |bibcode=2018Natur.557...30R |s2cid=14013938 |access-date=21 February 2021 |archive-date=9 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109033021/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4 |url-status=live  | issn = 0028-0836}}</ref> Second, he attempted to devise a [[unified field theory]] by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include [[electromagnetism]] too. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream [[modern physics]]. His intellectual achievements and originality made ''Einstein'' broadly synonymous with ''genius''.<ref name="wordnetweb.princeton.edu" /> In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal ''[[Physics World]]'', Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Physics: past, present, future |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/physics-past-present-future/ |work=Physics World | date=6 December 1999|access-date=1 August 2023}}</ref>

In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]]'s borough of [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]], where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].<ref name="Bio" />

Albert attended St. Peter‘s [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]]  in Munich from the age of five. When he was eight, he was transferred to the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]], where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[{{GBurl|id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC|p=59}} 59–61]}}

In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich, but without success—they lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to the more efficient, [[alternating current]] alternative.<ref name="EQyag" /> The failure of their bid forced them to sell their Munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. The Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]], where they settled in [[Palazzo Cornazzani]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=University of Pavia |title=Einstein, Albert |url=http://musei.unipv.eu/msu/our-museums/historical-figures/albert-einstein/ |website=Museo per la Storia dell'Università di Pavia |publisher=University of Pavia |access-date=7 January 2023}}</ref> Einstein, then fifteen, stayed behind in Munich in order to finish his schooling. His father wanted him to study [[electrical engineering]], but he was a fractious pupil who found the Gymnasium's regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. He later wrote that the school's policy of strict [[rote learning]] was harmful to creativity. At the end of December 1894, a letter from a doctor persuaded the Luitpold's authorities to release him from its care, and he joined his family in Pavia.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=30–31}} While in Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled "On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether (classical element)|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field".{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}<ref name="1RgTv" />

Einstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior. He began teaching himself algebra, calculus and [[Euclidean geometry]] when he was twelve; he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] before his thirteenth birthday.<ref name="FVfDU" />{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=16}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The God Problem: How a Godless Cosmos Creates |edition=illustrated |first1=Howard |last1=Bloom |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-61614-552-1 |page=294 |url={{GBurl|id=xlEupJb4ojIC}} |access-date=8 August 2020 }} {{cite book| url = {{GBurl|id=xlEupJb4ojIC|pg=PT294}}| title = Extract of page 294| isbn = 978-1-61614-552-1| last1 = Bloom| first1 = Howard| date = 30 August 2012| publisher = Prometheus Books| access-date = 8 August 2020}}</ref> A family tutor, [[Max Talmud]], said that only a short time after he had given the twelve year old Einstein a geometry textbook, the boy "had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics&nbsp;... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=17}} Einstein recorded that he had "mastered [[integral]] and [[differential calculus]]" while still just fourteen.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=16}} His love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve, he was already confident that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=17}}

At thirteen, when his range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy,{{sfnp|Calaprice|Lipscombe|2005|p=8}} Talmud introduced Einstein to [[Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Kant became his favorite philosopher; according to Talmud, "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=17}}

In 1895, at the age of sixteen, Einstein sat the entrance examination for the [[ETH Zurich|federal polytechnic school]] (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich, Switzerland. He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test,{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), p. 11}} but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=36–37}} On the advice of the polytechnic's principal, he completed his secondary education at the [[Old Cantonal School Aarau|Argovian cantonal school]] (a [[Gymnasium (school)|''gymnasium'']]) in [[Aarau]], Switzerland, graduating in 1896.<ref name="b250">{{cite journal | last=Hunziker | first=Herbert | title=Albert Einstein's Magic Mountain: An Aarau Education* | journal=Physics in Perspective | volume=17 | issue=1 | date=2015 | issn=1422-6944 | doi=10.1007/s00016-014-0153-5 | pages=55–69| bibcode=2015PhP....17...55H }} ref for: [[Old Cantonal School Aarau]]</ref> While lodging in Aarau with the family of [[Jost Winteler]], he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. (His sister, [[Maja Einstein|Maja]], later married Winteler's son Paul.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56–57}})

In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his [[German citizenship|citizenship of the German Kingdom of Württemberg]] in order to avoid [[Conscription in Germany|conscription into military service]].{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=40}} The ''[[Matura]]'' (graduation for the successful completion of higher secondary schooling), awarded to him in September 1896, acknowledged him to have performed well across most of the curriculum, allotting him a [[Grading systems by country#Switzerland|top grade of 6]] for history, physics, algebra, geometry, and descriptive geometry.{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), docs. 21–27}} At seventeen, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, a year older than him, took up a teaching post in [[Olsberg, Aargau|Olsberg]], Switzerland.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56–57}}

The five other polytechnic school freshmen following the same course as Einstein included just one woman, a twenty year old [[Serbs|Serbian]], [[Mileva Marić]]. Over the next few years, the pair spent many hours discussing their shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the polytechnic school's lectures did not cover. In his letters to Marić, Einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude. Eventually the two students became not only friends but also lovers.<ref name="mileva">{{Cite web|last=Gagnon|first=Pauline|date=19 December 2016|title=The Forgotten Life of Einstein's First Wife|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-forgotten-life-of-einsteins-first-wife/|access-date=17 October 2020|website=Scientific American Blog Network|archive-date=17 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017222145/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-forgotten-life-of-einsteins-first-wife/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historians of physics are divided on the question of the extent to which Marić contributed to the insights of Einstein's ''annus mirabilis'' publications. There is at least some evidence that he was influenced by her scientific ideas,<ref name="mileva" /><ref name="7HA7H" /><ref name="1zJdH" /> but there are scholars who doubt whether her impact on his thought was of any great significance at all.{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=1–29}}<ref name="xKrMG" />{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[{{GBurl|id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC|p=49}} 49–56]}}<ref name="dUxMl" />

[[File:Albert Einstein and Elsa Einstein arriving by ship, San Diego, 1930 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Albert Einstein and Elsa Einstein, 1930]]

Correspondence between Einstein and Marić, discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902, while Marić was visiting her parents in [[Novi Sad]], she gave birth to a daughter, [[Lieserl Einstein|Lieserl]]. When Marić returned to Switzerland it was without the child, whose fate is uncertain. A letter of Einstein's that he wrote in September 1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of [[scarlet fever]] in infancy.<ref name="HBMes" />{{sfnp|Calaprice|Lipscombe|2005|pp=22–23}}

Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son [[Hans Albert Einstein|Hans Albert]] was born in [[Bern]], Switzerland. Their son [[Einstein family#Eduard "Tete" Einstein (Albert's second son)|Eduard]] was born in Zürich in July 1910. In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before Eduard's arrival, he described his love for his wife as "misguided" and mourned the "missed life" that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be."<ref name="MlQLY" />

Following an episode of acute mental illness at about the age of twenty, Einstein's son Eduard was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="Robinson2015a" /> He spent the remainder of his life either in the care of his mother or in temporary confinement in an asylum. After her death, he was committed permanently to [[Burghölzli]], the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zürich.{{sfnp|Neffe|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinbiograph00neff/page/203 203]}}

=== 1902–1909: Assistant at the Swiss Patent Office ===
Einstein graduated from the federal polytechnic school in 1900, duly certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics.{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 67}} His successful acquisition of Swiss citizenship in February 1901{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=82}} was not followed by the usual sequel of [[conscription in Switzerland|conscription]]; the Swiss authorities deemed him medically unfit for military service. He found that Swiss schools too appeared to have no use for him, failing to offer him a teaching position despite the almost two years that he spent applying for one. Eventually it was with the help of [[Marcel Grossmann]]'s father that he secured a post in [[Bern]] at the [[Swiss Patent Office]],<ref name="ODY5p" />{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=63}} as an [[Patent examiner|assistant examiner – level III]].<ref name="MeZPN" /><ref name="IGEFAQ" />

[[Patent application]]s that landed on Einstein's desk for his evaluation included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter.<ref name="IGEFAQ" /> His employers were pleased enough with his work to make his position permanent in 1903, although they did not think that he should be promoted until he had "fully mastered machine technology".{{sfnp|Galison|2000|p=370}} It is conceivable that his labors at the patent office had a bearing on his development of his special theory of relativity. He arrived at his revolutionary ideas about space, time and light through thought experiments about the transmission of signals and the synchronization of clocks, matters which also figured in some of the inventions submitted to him for assessment.{{sfnp|Galison|2000|p=377}}

In 1902, Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern formed a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy. Their choice of a name for their club, the [[Olympia Academy]], was an ironic comment upon its far from Olympian status. Sometimes they were joined by Marić, who limited her participation in their proceedings to careful listening.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=96–98}} The thinkers whose works they reflected upon included [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]] and [[David Hume]], all of whom significantly influenced Einstein's own subsequent ideas and beliefs.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=79–84}}

=== 1908–1933: Early academic career ===
Einstein's sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908, when he secured a junior teaching position at the [[University of Bern]]. In 1909, a lecture on relativistic [[electrodynamics]] that he gave at the University of Zurich, much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to Zürich's luring him away from Bern with a newly created associate professorship.<ref name="bG2yp" /> Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when he accepted a chair at the German [[Charles-Ferdinand University]] in Prague, a move which required him to become an [[Cisleithania|Austrian]] citizen of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=164}}<ref name="Itl8r" /> His time in Prague saw him producing eleven research papers.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lyth |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRaGDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Einstein%22+%22Prague%22+%22Eleven%22&pg=PA122 |title=The Road to Einstein's Relativity: Following in the Footsteps of the Giants |date=31 January 2019 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-429-68268-1 |language=en}}</ref>

In July 1912, he returned to his ''alma mater'', the [[ETH Zurich]], to take up a chair in theoretical physics. His teaching activities there centred on [[thermodynamics]] and analytical mechanics, and his research interests included the molecular theory of heat, [[continuum mechanics]] and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation. In his work on the latter topic, he was assisted by his friend, Marcel Grossmann, whose knowledge of the kind of mathematics required was greater than his own.<ref name="hXQin" />

In the spring of 1913, two German visitors, [[Max Planck]] and [[Walther Nernst]], called upon Einstein in Zürich in the hope of persuading him to relocate to Berlin.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|p=534}} They offered him membership of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], the directorship of the planned [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]] and a chair at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial salary but with no teaching duties to burden him.<ref name=dh /> Their invitation was all the more appealing to him because Berlin happened to be the home of his latest girlfriend, Elsa Löwenthal.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|p=534}} He duly joined the Academy on 24 July 1913,<ref name="jstor.org">{{Cite web |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1687520 |title=Albert Einstein: His Influence on Physics, Philosophy and Politics JL Heilbron – 1982, Published by: American Association for the Advancement of Science ''via'' JSTOR |jstor=1687520 |access-date=22 November 2021 |archive-date=22 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122130724/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1687520 |url-status=live }}</ref> and moved into an apartment in the Berlin district of [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] on 1 April 1914.<ref name=dh /> He was installed in his Humboldt University position shortly thereafter.<ref name="jstor.org"/>

The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in July 1914 marked the beginning of Einstein's gradual estrangement from the nation of his birth. When the "[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]]" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German thinkers that justified Germany's belligerence—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to distance himself from it and sign the alternative, eirenic "[[Manifesto to the Europeans]]" instead.{{sfnp|Scheideler|2002|p=333}}{{Sfnp|Weinstein|2015|pp=18–19}} However, this expression of his doubts about German policy did not prevent him from being elected to a two-year term as president of the [[German Physical Society]] in 1916.{{sfnp|Calaprice|Lipscombe|2005|loc=[{{GBurl|id=5eWh2O_3OAQC|pg=PR19}} "Timeline", p. xix]}} When the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics opened its doors the following year—its foundation delayed because of the war—Einstein was appointed its first director, just as Planck and Nernst had promised.<ref name="EXcH6" />

Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1920,<ref name="3gcYy" /> and a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1921|Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1921]]. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".<ref name="Nobel Prize" /> At this point some physicists still regarded the general theory of relativity sceptically, and the Nobel citation displayed a degree of doubt even about the work on photoelectricity that it acknowledged: it did not assent to Einstein's notion of the particulate nature of light, which only won over the entire scientific community when [[S. N. Bose]] derived the [[Planck spectrum]] in 1924. That same year, Einstein was elected an International Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 February 2023 |title=Albert Einstein |url=https://www.amacad.org/person/albert-einstein |access-date=13 July 2023 |website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240221194114/https://www.amacad.org/person/albert-einstein |archive-date=21 February 2024}}</ref> Britain's closest equivalent of the Nobel award, the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]], was not hung around Einstein's neck until 1925.<ref name="frs" /> He was elected an International Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1930.<ref>{{Cite web |title=APS Member History |url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Albert+Einstein&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |access-date=13 July 2023 |website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

Einstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. His accomplishments in Berlin had included the completion of the general theory of relativity, proving the [[Einstein–de Haas effect]], contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and the development of [[Bose–Einstein statistics]].<ref name=dh />

=== 1919: Putting general relativity to the test ===
[[File:19191125 A New Physics Based on Einstein - The New York Times.png|thumb|right| ''The New York Times'' reported confirmation of the bending of light by gravitation after 
observations (made in [[Príncipe]] and [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral]]) of the 29 May 1919 eclipse were presented to a joint meeting in London of the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] on 6 November 1919.<ref name="NYTimes_19191125" />]]

In 1907, Einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of his [[equivalence principle]], which asserts that an observer in an infinitesimally small box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that the field exists. In 1911, he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be [[Gravitational lens|bent]] by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Sun's [[photosphere]] (that is, the Sun's apparent surface). He reworked his calculation in 1913, having now found a way to model gravitation with the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] of a non-Euclidean four-dimensional [[spacetime]]. By the fall of 1915, his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of Riemannian geometry was complete, and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the Sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon, the [[precession of the perihelion of Mercury]] (a slow drift in the point in Mercury's elliptical orbit at which it approaches the Sun most closely).<ref name=dh /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Weinberg |first1=Steven |title=Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and applications of the general theory of relativity |date=1972 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |isbn=9788126517558 |pages=19–20}}</ref> A [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|total eclipse of the Sun that took place on 29 May 1919]] provided an opportunity to put his theory of gravitational lensing to the test, and observations performed by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] yielded results that were consistent with his calculations. Eddington's work was reported at length in newspapers around the world. On 7 November 1919, for example, the leading British newspaper, ''[[The Times]]'', printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science&nbsp;– New Theory of the Universe&nbsp;– Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".<ref name="Eddington" />

=== 1921–1923: Coming to terms with fame ===
[[File:Albert Einstein (Nobel).png|thumb|upright|left|Einstein's official portrait after receiving the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics]]

With Eddington's eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well, Einstein became "perhaps the world's first celebrity scientist", a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists' understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-celebrity-scientist-albert-einstein-used-fame-denounce-american-racism-180962356/|last=Francis|first=Matthew|title=How Albert Einstein Used His Fame to Denounce American Racism|date=3 March 2017|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine}}</ref>

Einstein began his new life as an intellectual icon in America, where he arrived on 2 April 1921. He was welcomed to New York City by Mayor [[John Francis Hylan]], and then spent three weeks giving lectures and attending receptions.<ref>Falk, Dan, ''[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/one-hundred-years-ago-einstein-was-given-heros-welcome-americas-jews-180977386/ One Hundred Years Ago, Einstein Was Given a Hero's Welcome by America's Jews] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210403140031/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/one-hundred-years-ago-einstein-was-given-heros-welcome-americas-jews-180977386/ |date=3 April 2021 }}'', Smithsonian, 2 April 2021</ref> He spoke several times at [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton]], and in Washington, he visited the [[White House]] with representatives of the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. He returned to Europe via London, where he was the guest of the philosopher and statesman [[Viscount Haldane]]. He used his time in the British capital to meet several people prominent in British scientific, political or intellectual life, and to deliver a lecture at [[King's College London|King's College]].{{Sfnp|Hoffmann|1972|pp=145–148}}{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=499–508}} In July 1921, he published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.", in which he sought to sketch the American character, much as had [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835).<ref name="7gwHd" /> He wrote of his transatlantic hosts in highly approving terms: "What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."{{sfnp|Holton|1984|p=20}}

In 1922, Einstein's travels were to the old world rather than the new. He devoted six months to a tour of Asia that saw him speaking in Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka (then known as [[Ceylon]]). After his first public lecture in Tokyo, he met [[Emperor Yoshihito]] and his wife at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]], with thousands of spectators thronging the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of him. (In a letter to his sons, he wrote that Japanese people seemed to him to be generally modest, intelligent and considerate, and to have a true appreciation of art.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=307–308}} But his picture of them in his diary was less flattering: "[the] intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones – natural disposition?" His journal also contains views of China and India which were uncomplimentary. Of Chinese people, he wrote that "even the children are spiritless and look obtuse... It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary".<ref name="38YkY" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Katz|first=Brigit|title=Einstein's Travel Diaries Reveal His Deeply Troubling Views on Race|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-his-deeply-troubling-views-race-180969387/|access-date=3 January 2021|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|archive-date=25 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225201826/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-his-deeply-troubling-views-race-180969387/|url-status=live}}</ref>) He was greeted with even greater enthusiasm on the last leg of his tour, in which he spent twelve days in [[Mandatory Palestine]], newly entrusted to British rule by the [[League of Nations]] in the aftermath of the First World War. [[Sir Herbert Samuel]], the British High Commissioner, welcomed him with a degree of ceremony normally only accorded to a visiting head of state, including a cannon salute. One reception held in his honor was stormed by people determined to hear him speak: he told them that he was happy that Jews were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=308}}

Einstein's decision to tour the eastern hemisphere in 1922 meant that he was unable to go to [[Stockholm]] in the December of that year to participate in the Nobel prize ceremony. His place at the traditional Nobel banquet was taken by a German diplomat, who gave a speech praising him not only as a physicist but also as a campaigner for peace.<ref name="oxak7" /> A two-week visit to Spain that he undertook in 1923 saw him collecting another award, a membership of the Spanish Academy of Sciences signified by a diploma handed to him by [[King Alfonso XIII]]. (His Spanish trip also gave him a chance to meet a fellow Nobel laureate, the neuroanatomist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]].)<ref name="w74nv" />

=== 1922–1932: Serving the League of Nations ===
[[File:League of Nations Commission 067.tif|thumb|Einstein at a session of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] ([[League of Nations]]) of which he was a member from 1922 to 1932]]
From 1922 until 1932, with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924, Einstein was a member of the Geneva-based [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] of the [[League of Nations]], a group set up by the League to encourage scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries.<ref name="Q5hgx" /><ref name="vNNnX" /> He was appointed as a German delegate rather than as a representative of Switzerland because of the machinations of two Catholic activists, [[Oskar Halecki]] and [[Giuseppe Motta]]. By persuading Secretary General [[Eric Drummond]] to deny Einstein the place on the committee reserved for a Swiss thinker, they created an opening for [[Gonzague de Reynold]], who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrine.<ref name="e9Xyh" /> Einstein's former physics professor [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and the Polish chemist [[Marie Curie]] were also members of the committee.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations |journal=Science |date=6 August 1926 |volume=64 |issue=1649 |pages=132–133 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651869 |access-date=30 May 2022 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|doi=10.1126/science.64.1649.132.b |jstor=1651869 |s2cid=239778182 }}</ref>

=== 1925: Touring South America ===
In March and April 1925, Einstein and his wife visited South America, where they spent about a week in Brazil, a week in Uruguay and a month in Argentina.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4940-1_6|chapter=Science and Ideology in Einstein's Visit to South America in 1925|editor= Lehner, Christoph|editor2=Renn, Jürgen|editor3=Schemmel, Matthias|title=Einstein and the Changing Worldviews of Physics|year=2012|last1=Tolmasquim|first1=Alfredo Tiomno|pages=117–133|isbn=978-0-8176-4939-5}}</ref> Their tour was suggested by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935)<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0269889708001853|title=Einstein's Unpublished Opening Lecture for His Course on Relativity Theory in Argentina, 1925|year=2008|last1=Gangui|first1=Alejandro|last2=Ortiz|first2=Eduardo L.|journal=Science in Context|volume=21|issue=3|pages=435–450|arxiv=0903.2064|s2cid=54920641}}</ref> with the support of several Argentine scholars, including [[Julio Rey Pastor]], [[Jakob Laub]], and [[Leopoldo Lugones]]. and was financed primarily by the Council of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and the ''Asociación Hebraica Argentina'' (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution.<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=1603.03792|last1=Gangui|first1=Alejandro|last2=Ortiz|first2=Eduardo L.|title=The scientific impact of Einstein's visit to Argentina, in 1925|year=2016|class=physics.hist-ph}}</ref>

=== 1930–1931: Touring the US ===
In December 1930, Einstein began another significant sojourn in the United States, drawn back to the US by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. Caltech supported him in his wish that he should not be exposed to quite as much attention from the media as he had experienced when visiting the US in 1921, and he therefore declined all the invitations to receive prizes or make speeches that his admirers poured down upon him. But he remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with him that they requested.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=368}}

After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], a lunch with the editors of ''The New York Times'', and a performance of ''Carmen'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] and met [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], the president of [[Columbia University]], who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}} [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]], pastor at New York's [[Riverside Church]], gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}} Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] during a [[Hanukkah]] celebration.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}}

[[File:Albert Einstein and Charlie Chaplin City Lights premiere 1931.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|left|Einstein with [[Charlie Chaplin]] at the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] premiere of Chaplin's ''[[City Lights]]'', January 1931]]

Einstein next traveled to California, where he met [[Caltech]] president and Nobel laureate [[Robert A. Millikan]]. His friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism", where Einstein was a pronounced [[pacifist]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=373}} During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=374}}

This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author [[Upton Sinclair]] and film star [[Charlie Chaplin]], both noted for their pacifism. [[Carl Laemmle]], head of [[Universal Studios]], gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament", from which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy".{{sfnp|Chaplin|1964|p=320}}

Chaplin's film ''[[City Lights]]'' was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. [[Walter Isaacson]], Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=374}} Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was "possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis".{{sfnp|Chaplin|1964|p=322}}

=== 1933: Emigration to the US ===

He is rolling up his sleeves and holding a sword labeled "Preparedness".|Cartoon of Einstein after shedding his "pacifism" wings ([[Charles R. Macauley]], {{circa|1933}})]]
In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] under Germany's new chancellor, [[Adolf Hitler]].{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=659}}{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=404}}

While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in Pasadena. In February and March 1933, the [[Gestapo]] repeatedly raided his family's apartment in Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Albert Einstein Quits Germany, Renounces Citizenship|url=https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/albert-einstein-quits-germany-renounces-citizenship|access-date=14 March 2021|website=History Unfolded: US Newspapers and the Holocaust|language=en|archive-date=17 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417085304/https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/albert-einstein-quits-germany-renounces-citizenship|url-status=live}}</ref> He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag had passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] on 23 March, transforming Hitler's government into a ''de facto'' legal dictatorship, and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided by the Nazis and Einstein's personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in [[Antwerp]], Belgium on 28 March, Einstein immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a [[Hitler Youth]] camp.<ref name="el4GB" />

==== Refugee status ====
[[File:Einstein's landing card (5706142737).jpg|thumb|Landing card for Einstein's 26 May 1933 arrival in [[Dover]], England from [[Ostend]], Belgium, enroute to [[Oxford]]]]

In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|laws barring Jews from holding any official positions]], including teaching at universities.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} Historian [[Gerald Holton]] describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.{{sfnp|Holton|1984|p=}}

A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the [[German Student Union]] in the [[Nazi book burnings]], with Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaiming, "Jewish intellectualism is dead."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}}<ref name="Jerome" /> In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend [[Max Born]], who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, "...&nbsp;I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a "spontaneous emotional outburst" by those who "shun popular enlightenment", and "more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1954|p=197}}

Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. Aided by the [[Academic Assistance Council]], founded in April 1933 by British Liberal politician [[William Beveridge]] to help academics escape Nazi persecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany.<ref name="Albert Hall">{{cite web |url=https://www.royalalberthall.com/about-the-hall/news/2013/october/3-october-1933-albert-einstein-speaks-at-the-hall/ |title=3 October 1933 – Albert Einstein presents his final speech given in Europe, at the Royal Albert Hall |last=Keyte |first=Suzanne |date=9 October 2013 |website=Royal Albert Hall |access-date=20 June 2022}}</ref> He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the British Member of Parliament Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]], who had become friends with him in the preceding years.<ref>{{cite book| first=Andrew | last=Robinson | author-link=W.

To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the ''Daily Herald'' on 24 July 1933.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=422}}<ref name="3zIp7" />

[[File:Churchill and Einstein in 1933.jpg|thumb|[[Winston Churchill]] and Einstein at [[Chartwell]] House, 31 May 1933]]
Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet [[Winston Churchill]] at his home, and later, [[Austen Chamberlain]] and former Prime Minister [[Lloyd George]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=419–420}} Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian [[Martin Gilbert]] notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist [[Frederick Lindemann]], to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.<ref name="Gilbert" /> Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]]' technology ahead of theirs.<ref name="Gilbert" />

Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including [[Turkey]]'s Prime Minister, [[İsmet İnönü]], to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved individuals".<ref name="aDu8s" />

Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere.<ref name="AP" /> In his speech he described Einstein as a "citizen of the world" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.<ref group=note name="gnriE" /><ref name="Guardian" /> Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], US, to become a resident scholar.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}

==== Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study ====
[[File:Einstein-formal portrait-35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Einstein taken in 1935 at Princeton]]

On 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, with ''[[The Times]]'' reporting he was wildly cheered throughout.<ref name="Albert Hall" /> Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]],{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=649, 678}} noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.<ref name="Arntzenius2011" /> At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their [[Jewish quota]]s, which lasted until the late 1940s.<ref name="Arntzenius2011" />

Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a five-year research [[fellowship]] (called a "[[studentship]]" at Christ Church),<ref name="FFt5E" /><ref name="v8v06" /> but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=686–687}}

Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.<ref name="mzNc5" /> He was one of the four first selected (along with [[John von Neumann]], [[Kurt Gödel]], and [[Hermann Weyl]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Weyl |first1=Hermann |editor1-last=Pesic |editor1-first=Peter |title=Levels of Infinity: Selected Writings on Mathematics and Philosophy |date=2013 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=9780486266930 |page=5 |url={{GBurl|id=Dd-vAAAAQBAJ}} |access-date=30 May 2022 |quote=By 1933, Weyl... left for the newly-founded Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, where his colleagues included Einstein, Kurt Gödel, and John von Neumann.}}</ref>) at the new Institute. He soon developed a close friendship with Gödel; the two would take long walks together discussing their work. [[Bruria Kaufman]], his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a [[unified field theory]] and to refute the [[Copenhagen interpretation|accepted interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]], both unsuccessfully. He lived in Princeton at his home from 1935 onwards. The [[Albert Einstein House]] was made a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.

==== World War II and the Manhattan Project ====
{{See also|Einstein–Szilárd letter}}
[[File:München-2021-Deutsches_Museum-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Marble bust of Einstein at the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]]]]

In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] attempted to alert [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]], "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the [[German nuclear energy project|race to build an atomic bomb]], and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=630}}<ref name="o4fkQ" /> To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.<ref name="pRqWK" /> He was asked to lend his support by writing [[Einstein–Szilard letter|a letter]], with Szilárd, to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.

The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II".<ref name="4Z68g" /> In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the [[Belgian royal family]]<ref name="eZym8" /> and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]].

For Einstein, "war was a disease&nbsp;... [and] he called for resistance to war." By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.<ref name="z73PK" /> In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, [[Linus Pauling]], "I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them&nbsp;..."{{Sfnp|Clark|1971|p=752}} In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], signed [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto|a manifesto]] highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|url=https://pugwash.org/1955/07/09/statement-manifesto/|title=The Russell-Einstein Manifesto|last2=Russell|first2=Bertrand|date=9 July 1955|location=London|access-date=9 June 2021|archive-date=1 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301114337/https://pugwash.org/1955/07/09/statement-manifesto/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1960 Einstein was included posthumously as a charter member of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]] (WAAS),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Boyko |first1=Hugo |title=Science and the Future of Mankind |publisher=Indiana University Press |page=377 |url=https://www.worldacademy.org/files/publications/Science%20and%20the%20Future%20of%20Mankind.pdf}}</ref> an organization founded by distinguished scientists and intellectuals who committed themselves to the responsible and ethical advances of science, particularly in light of the development of nuclear weapons.

==== US citizenship ====
[[File:Citizen-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein accepting a [[Citizenship of the United States|US citizenship]] certificate from judge [[Phillip Forman]]]]

Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the [[meritocracy]] in American culture compared to Europe. He recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased" without social barriers. As a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his early education.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=432}}

Einstein joined the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the [[Civil rights movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] of African Americans. He considered racism America's "worst disease",<ref name="Jerome" /><ref name="smithsonianmag">{{cite news |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-celebrity-scientist-albert-einstein-used-fame-denounce-american-racism-180962356 |title=How Albert Einstein Used His Fame to Denounce American Racism |first=Matthew |last=Francis |date=3 March 2017 |work=Smithsonian Magazine |access-date=10 February 2021 |archive-date=11 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211150143/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-celebrity-scientist-albert-einstein-used-fame-denounce-american-racism-180962356/ |url-status=live }}</ref> seeing it as "handed down from one generation to the next".{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2005|pp=148–149}} As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist [[W.

In 1946, Einstein visited [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in Pennsylvania, a [[historically black college]], where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]]. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it."<ref name="Jerome_Isis" /> A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.<ref name="civil" /> Einstein has said, "Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination".<ref name="smithsonianmag"/>

In 1925, he criticized them for not having a "well-regulated system of government" and called their rule a "regime of terror and a tragedy in human history". He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on [[Vladimir Lenin]]:
{{blockquote|In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind's conscience.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2013|pp=[{{GBurl|id=_X1dAAAAQBAJ|pg=413}} 412, 413]}}}}
Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic [[global government]] that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=487, 494, 550}} He wrote "I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself."<ref>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 4 (February 1948), No. 2 35–37: 'A Reply to the Soviet Scientists, December 1947'</ref> The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932; by the time of his death, it was 1,427 pages long.<ref name="ixWWZ" />

Einstein was deeply impressed by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], with whom he corresponded. He described Gandhi as "a role model for the generations to come".<ref name="Albano-Müller" /> The initial connection was established on 27 September 1931, when [[Wilfrid Israel]] took his Indian guest [[V. A. Sundaram]] to meet his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh. Sundaram was Gandhi's disciple and special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leader's home in 1925. During the visit, Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy, and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through Wilfrid Israel.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://streams.gandhiserve.org/einstein.html| title = Einstein's letter and Gandhi's answer| access-date = 22 August 2021| archive-date = 9 June 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140609031152/http://streams.gandhiserve.org/einstein.html| url-status = live}}, gandhiserve.org</ref>

Einstein was not a [[nationalist]] and opposed the creation of an independent Jewish state.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2007|p=33}} He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the [[Aliyah]] could live alongside existing Arabs in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The state of [[Israel]] was established without his help in 1948; Einstein was limited to a marginal role in the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ze'ev |last=Rosenkranz |date=2011 |title=Einstein Before Israel: Zionist Icon Or Iconoclast? |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=4–5 |isbn=978-0-691-14412-2}}</ref> Upon the death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of [[President of Israel]] at the urging of [[Ezriel Carlebach]].<ref name="Time" /><ref name="Msb2q" /> The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, [[Abba Eban]], who explained that the offer "embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}} Einstein wrote that he was "deeply moved", but "at once saddened and ashamed" that he could not accept it.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}}

==== Religious and philosophical views ====

----
"Ladies (coughs) and gentlemen, our age is proud of the progress it has made in man's intellectual development. The search and striving for truth and knowledge is one of the highest of man's qualities&nbsp;..."]]
{{Main|Religious and philosophical views of Albert Einstein}}
Einstein expounded his spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews.<ref name="018QJ" /> He said he had sympathy for the impersonal [[pantheistic]] God of [[Spinozism|Baruch Spinoza's philosophy]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[{{GBurl|id=G_iziBAPXtEC|p=325}} 325]}} He did not believe in a [[personal god]] who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve.{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2000|p=218}} He clarified, however, that "I am not an atheist",{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[{{GBurl|id=cdxWNE7NY6QC|pg=PT390}} 390]}} preferring to call himself an agnostic,{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2010|p=[{{GBurl|id=G_iziBAPXtEC|p=340}} 340]}}<ref name="flickr2687" /> or a "deeply religious nonbeliever".{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2000|p=218}} When asked if he believed in an [[afterlife]], Einstein replied, "No. And one life is enough for me."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[{{GBurl|id=OzSJgdwk5esC|pg=PT461}} 461]}}

Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious [[Secular humanist|humanist]] and [[Ethical Culture]] groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the [[First Humanist Society of New York]],<ref name="mKToJ" /> and was an honorary associate of the [[Rationalist Association]], which publishes ''[[New Humanist]]'' in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the [[New York Society for Ethical Culture]], he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, "Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity."{{sfnp|Einstein|1995|p=[{{GBurl|id=9fJkBqwDD3sC|p=62}} 62]}}

In a German-language letter to philosopher [[Eric Gutkind]], dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:<blockquote>[[God (word)|The word God]] is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the [[Jewish religion]] like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the [[Jewish people]] to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I cannot see anything '[[Jews as the chosen people|chosen]]' about them.<ref name="xI99y" /></blockquote>

Einstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. In a letter in 1930 to Hermann Huth, vice-president of the [[ProVeg Deutschland#History|German Vegetarian Federation (Deutsche Vegetarier-Bund)]], he wrote:<blockquote>Although I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ivu.org/history/northam20a/einstein.html

He became a vegetarian himself only during the last part of his life. In March 1954 he wrote in a letter: "So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aretheyvegan.com/alberteinstein/

==== Love of music ====
[[File:Wanda von Debschitz-Kunowski Albert Einstein beim Geigenspiel 1927.jpg|thumb|Einstein playing the violin (image published in 1927)]]
Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote:

{{blockquote|If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music&nbsp;... I get most joy in life out of music.<ref name="BQH5A" /><ref name="aBOjz" />}}

His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into [[German culture]]. According to conductor [[Leon Botstein]], Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.<ref name="Botstein" />

When he turned 13, he discovered the [[Mozart violin sonatas|violin sonatas of Mozart]], whereupon he became enamored of [[Mozart]]'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without "ever practicing systematically". He said that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty".<ref name="Botstein" /> At the age of 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing [[Beethoven's violin sonatas (disambiguation)<!-- intentional -->|Beethoven's violin sonatas]]. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight{{' "}}. What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."<ref name="Botstein" />

Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played [[chamber music]] were a few professionals, including Kurt Appelbaum, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the [[Köchel catalog]] of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by [[Alfred Einstein]], who may have been a distant relation.<ref name="kGuWC" /><ref name="OIn6p" />

In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of [[Beethoven]] and Mozart's works with members of the [[Zoellner Quartet]].<ref name="Times" /><ref name="RR" /> Near the end of his life, when the young [[Juilliard Quartet]] visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was "impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation".<ref name="Botstein" />

=== Death ===
On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced [[internal bleeding]] caused by the rupture of an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]], which had previously been reinforced surgically by [[Rudolph Nissen]] in 1948.<ref name="BXLfp" /> He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.<ref name="QN45b" />

Einstein refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."<ref name="BhiNM" /> He died in the [[Princeton Hospital]] early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.<ref name="YUhsl" />

During the autopsy, the pathologist [[Thomas Stoltz Harvey]] removed [[Einstein's brain]] for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the [[neuroscience]] of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent.<ref name="MqyYW" /> Einstein's remains were cremated in [[Trenton, New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Cosgrove|first1=Benjamin|last2=Morse|first2=Ralph|url=https://www.life.com/history/the-day-albert-einstein-died-a-photographers-story/|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|title=The Day Albert Einstein Died: A Photographer's Story|date=14 March 2014|access-date=10 March 2021|archive-date=19 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319004714/https://www.life.com/history/the-day-albert-einstein-died-a-photographers-story/|url-status=live}}</ref> and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.<ref name="GQrBZ" /><ref name="Obit" />

In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at [[UNESCO]] headquarters, nuclear physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] summarized his [[Einstein–Oppenheimer relationship|impression of Einstein]] as a person: "He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness&nbsp;... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn."<ref name="aJHxn" />

Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in Israel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Unna|first=Issachar|date=22 June 2007|title=An Ongoing Power of Attraction|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.4945718|access-date=15 June 2021|archive-date=16 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616043403/https://www.haaretz.com/1.4945718|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Scientific career ==
Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles.<ref name="Bio" /><ref name="Paul Arthur Schilpp, editor 1951 730–746" /> He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones.<ref name="Nobel" /><ref name="Paul Arthur Schilpp, editor 1951 730–746" /> On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents.{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008}}<ref name="NYT-20141204-DB" /> Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".<ref name="wordnetweb.princeton.edu" /> In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the [[Bose–Einstein statistics]], the [[Einstein refrigerator]] and others.<ref name="Instituut-Lorentz" /><ref name="e5xd8" />

These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of [[History of physics#Modern physics|modern physics]] and changed views on [[space]], time, and [[matter]]. The four papers are:

=== Statistical mechanics ===

==== Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics ====
{{Main|Statistical mechanics|thermal fluctuations|statistical physics}}

Einstein's first paper{{Sfnp|Einstein|1901}}<ref name="PubList" /> submitted in 1900 to ''Annalen der Physik'' was on [[capillary attraction]]. It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.<ref name="PubList" />

==== Theory of critical opalescence ====
{{Main|Critical opalescence}}
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref name="L2N73" /> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

=== Special relativity ===
{{Main|History of special relativity}}
Einstein's "{{lang|de|Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper}}"{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}} ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between [[Maxwell's equations]] (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=178–198}} Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the [[speed of light]]). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.

This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to [[Time dilation|slow down]], and the body itself would [[Length contraction|contract]] in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.<ref group=note name="aBfxO" />

In his paper on [[mass–energy equivalence]], Einstein produced ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''<sup>2</sup> as a consequence of his special relativity equations.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=vi, 15, 90, 131, [{{GBurl|id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC|p=215}} 215]}} Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].<ref group=note name="sBl2q" />{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=382–386}}

Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]] reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of [[spacetime]]. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 [[general theory of relativity]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=151–152}}

=== General relativity ===

[[General relativity]] (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to it, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]; it provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fraknoi |first=Andrew |url=https://openstax.org/details/books/astronomy-2e |title=Astronomy 2e |date=2022 |display-authors=etal |publisher=OpenStax |isbn=978-1-951693-50-3 |edition=2e |oclc=1322188620 |pages=800–815}}</ref>

As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational redshift]] and [[gravitational lensing]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179–183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900–1909|pp=273–274}}

In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194–195}}

==== Gravitational waves ====
In 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,{{sfnp|Einstein|1916}}{{sfnp|Einstein|1918}} ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its [[Lorentz invariance]] which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]], which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.

The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting [[neutron stars]], [[PSR B1913+16]].<ref name="natgeo" /> The explanation for the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.<ref name="natgeo" /><ref name="Tf1T0" /> Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at [[LIGO]] published the [[first observation of gravitational waves]],<ref name="PRL-20160211" /> detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.<ref name="natgeo" /><ref name="CO6kH" /><ref name="oSmHb" /><ref name="hkKSp" /><ref name="38Msx" />

==== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ====
While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Norton |first=John |author-link=John D. Norton |date=1984 |title=How Einstein Found His Field Equations: 1912–1915 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27757535 |journal=Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=253–316 |doi=10.2307/27757535 |jstor=27757535 |issn=0073-2672}}</ref>

In June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref name="sOA9t" /> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.

==== Physical cosmology ====
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
[[File:MillikanLemaitreEinstein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert A. Millikan]], [[Georges Lemaître]], and Einstein at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in January 1933]]

In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], into the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of [[Mach's principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein's static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285–286}}<ref name="iJwuX" />

Following the discovery of the recession of the galaxies by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, the [[Friedmann–Einstein universe]] of 1931{{sfnp|Einstein|1931}}<ref name="cor-2013" /> and the [[Einstein–de Sitter universe]] of 1932.{{sfnp|Einstein|de Sitter|1932}}<ref name="J9Tqu" /> In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was "in any case theoretically unsatisfactory".{{sfnp|Einstein|1931}}<ref name="cor-2013" /><ref name="sxfvo" />

In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder", based on a letter [[George Gamow]] claimed to have received from him. The astrophysicist [[Mario Livio]] has cast doubt on this claim.<ref name="qmmVf" />

In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist [[Cormac O'Raifeartaigh]] discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the galaxies, Einstein considered a [[steady-state model]] of the universe.<ref name="Tq53z" /><ref name="8pfEk" /> In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process that he associated with the cosmological constant.<ref name="cor-steady-state" /><ref name="Einstein's aborted model" /> As he stated in the paper, "In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [''sic''] facts, and in which the density is constant over time" ... "If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."

It thus appears that Einstein considered a [[steady-state model]] of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.<ref name="ILjYQ" /><ref name="ThZb0" /> However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.<ref name="cor-steady-state" /><ref name="Einstein's aborted model" /><ref name="7ShC9" />

==== Energy momentum pseudotensor ====
{{Main|Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor}}
General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by [[Emmy Noether|Noether]]'s prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.<ref>{{cite arXiv|first=Nina |last=Byers |author-link=Nina Byers |title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws |eprint=physics/9807044 |date=23 September 1998}}</ref>

Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. While the use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was criticized by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and others, Einstein's approach has been echoed by physicists including [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.111.315 |first=J. N. |last=Goldberg |title=Conservation laws in general relativity |year=1958 |journal=Physical Review |volume=111 |number=1 |pages=315–320|bibcode=1958PhRv..111..315G }}</ref>

==== Wormholes ====
In 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein–Rosen bridges]].{{sfnp|Einstein|Rosen|1935}}<ref name="QNjpt" /> His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches. Because these solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body, Einstein and Rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles. However, it was later found that Einstein–Rosen bridges are not stable.<ref name="ja7FY" />

==== Einstein–Cartan theory ====
{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.

==== Equations of motion ====
{{Main|Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations}}
In general relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of [[spacetime]]. A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses. A remark by [[John Archibald Wheeler]] that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory: "Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve."<ref name="Wheeler">{{Cite book|last=Wheeler|first=John Archibald|url={{GBurl|id=zGFkK2tTXPsC|p=235}}|title=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics|date=18 June 2010|publisher=W.

The [[geodesic equation]] covers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow [[Geodesics in general relativity|lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime]]. Einstein regarded this as an "independent fundamental assumption" that had to be postulated in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory. Believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally presented, he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves. Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. Accordingly, Einstein proposed that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic. Both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a [[gravitational singularity]], but this claim remains disputed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tamir |first=M |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9158/1/Tamir_-_Proving_the_Principle.pdf |title=Proving the principle: Taking geodesic dynamics too seriously in Einstein's theory |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=43 |number=2 |pages=137–154 |year=2012 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2011.12.002|bibcode=2012SHPMP..43..137T }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Malament |first=David |chapter=A Remark About the "Geodesic Principle" in General Relativity |author-link=David Malament |chapter-url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/5072/1/GeodesicLaw.pdf |title=Analysis and Interpretation in the Exact Sciences |pages=245–252 |series=The Western Ontario Series in Philosophy of Science |volume=78 |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |editor-last1=Frappier |editor-first1=M. |editor-last2=Brown |editor-first2=D. |editor-last3=DiSalle |editor-first3=R. |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-2582-9_14 |isbn=978-94-007-2581-2 |quote=Though the geodesic principle can be recovered as theorem in general relativity, it is not a consequence of Einstein's equation (or the conservation principle) alone.

==== Photons and energy quanta ====
[[File:Photoelectric effect in a solid - diagram.svg|alt=|thumb|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]
In a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (''[[quantum|quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].

Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of photons with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. He did not say much more, because he was not sure how the particles were related to the wave. But he did suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}

==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====
{{Main|Einstein solid}}
In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref name="ixm32" />

==== Bose–Einstein statistics ====
{{Main|Bose–Einstein statistics}}
In 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[NIST]]–[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].<ref name="nlagl" /> Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.<ref name="Instituut-Lorentz" />

==== Wave–particle duality ====
[[File:Albert Einstein 1921 (re-cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein in 1921, photo by Harris & Ewing Studio]]
Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}} In "''Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''" ("[[s:Translation:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave–particle duality]] in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.

==== Zero-point energy ====
In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of [[zero-point energy]] in his "second quantum theory". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912–1914|pp=270ff}}

==== Stimulated emission ====
In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}
This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Duncan |first1=Anthony |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1119627546 |title=Constructing quantum mechanics.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
==== Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics ====
[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper headline on 4 May 1935]]
Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God "is not playing at dice".<ref name="zZ2hS" /> Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.<ref name="yzZtL" />

==== Bohr versus Einstein ====
{{Main|Bohr–Einstein debates}}
[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein4 by Ehrenfest cr.jpg|upright|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed. A dark-haired Bohr is talking while Einstein looks skeptical.|thumb|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], 1925]] The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the [[philosophy of science]].<ref name="Bohr1949" />{{Sfnp|Einstein|1969}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Schlosshauer |first1=Maximilian |last2=Kofler |first2=Johannes |last3=Zeilinger |first3=Anton |date=1 August 2013 |title=A snapshot of foundational attitudes toward quantum mechanics |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=222–230 |arxiv=1301.1069 |bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004 |issn=1355-2198 |s2cid=55537196}}</ref> Their debates would influence later [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].

==== Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ====
{{Main|EPR paradox}}
Einstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics. While he recognized that it made correct predictions, he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible. Over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with Bohr in 1930. Einstein suggested a [[Einstein's thought experiments|thought experiment]] in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other. The quantum-mechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a [[wavefunction]]. If the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given, then the [[Schrödinger equation]] provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction. But because of what would later be called [[quantum entanglement]], measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away it is. Moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object. Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast. Indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question. Because the true "physical condition" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein concluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of it.{{sfnp|Howard|1990}}{{sfnp|Harrigan|Spekkens|2010}}

A more famous version of this argument came in 1935, when Einstein published a paper with [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]] that laid out what would become known as the [[EPR paradox]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} In this thought experiment, two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled. Then, no matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict, perfectly, the result of measuring the position of the other particle. Likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way. They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other, since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the [[theory of relativity]]. They invoked a principle, later known as the "EPR criterion of reality", positing that: "If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with [[probability]] equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity." From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured. But quantum mechanics considers these two observables [[Observable#Incompatibility of observables in quantum mechanics|incompatible]] and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality.{{sfnp|Peres|2002}}

In 1964, [[John Stewart Bell]] carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. He deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. This constraint would later be called a [[Bell inequality]]. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. Consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are "nonlocal", which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated.{{sfnp|Mermin|1993}}{{sfnp|Penrose|2007}} Bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality, the EPR paradox "is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least".{{sfnp|Bell|1966}}

Despite this, and although Einstein personally found the argument in the EPR paper overly complicated,{{sfnp|Howard|1990}}{{sfnp|Harrigan|Spekkens|2010}} that paper became among the most influential papers published in ''[[Physical Review]]''. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of [[quantum information theory]].{{Sfnp|Fine|2017}}

=== Unified field theory ===
{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}
Encouraged by his success with general relativity, Einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, he described his [[unified field theory]] in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article titled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} His attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not success: a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, neither of which was well understood until many years after his death. Although most researchers now believe that Einstein's approach to unifying physics was mistaken, his goal of a [[theory of everything]] is one to which his successors still aspire.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Goenner |first=Hubert F.

In 1908, [[Owen Willans Richardson]] predicted that a change in the [[magnetic moment]] of a free body will cause this body to rotate.

While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986<ref name="margot-obituary" />).
